      Hello. Thanks for making it to view source. I spent time on all of this.
      I take great pride in building things small and large on the Internet.

      Salary isn't anything but a number to me.
      I've worked for a few different numbers in my career.
      In the past, I worked for less. I've been told the next number gets bigger.
      Recently, I've questioned that last part. There's a balance somewhere.

      My last number. I'm worth it but I'm not expecting it.
      The next number is a discussion.

      It takes into account
        who is offering.
        what kind of salary can be offered.
        the work that I'm doing.
        how often I'll be doing it.
        how much I enjoy doing it.
        where I can do it from.

      It gets answered when I know more about you.
      Reply to my email and let's set up an interview.
